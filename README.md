## There are 3 Courses in this Specialization

### COURSE 1
### Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

In the first course of the Machine Learning Specialization, you will:
- Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn.
- Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression

### COURSE 2
### Advanced Learning Algorithms

In the second course of the Machine Learning Specialization, you will:
- Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification
- Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world
- Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees

### COURSE 3
### Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning
In the third course of the Machine Learning Specialization, you will:
- Use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning: including clustering and anomaly detection.
- Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method.
- Build a deep reinforcement learning model.
